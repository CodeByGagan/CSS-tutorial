    <p>In order to avoid plagiarism one first needs to know how to 
        recognize it. So first weâ€™ll look at original sources from a 
        Political Science text, a photograph from the National Archives
         of Canada, and a graph from Statistics Canada and then some 
         samples, using these sources, of how plagiarism might occur in
          student writing and how to steer clear of plagiarizing. </p>
